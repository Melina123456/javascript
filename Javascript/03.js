//Now moving on here we are learning is the rules for naming variables
//1.you cannot start with number like var 1val, this is invalid 
//2. you can only use underscore and dollar symbol 
//$firstName is also valid 
var _FirstName = "Melina Thapa ";
console.log(_FirstName);

// you could use dollar in betwn, at start .

//If we write underscore in name , that is calles snake case writing like first_name
//If we write like firstName , It is called camel case writing .

//3. convention that is start with small letter and use camelCase.
